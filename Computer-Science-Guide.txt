Requirements:

- an interest


- a computer


- internet access








How should one learn?

You should 100% be self-taught; i.e. not taking programming classes at your school,
not going to a programming bootcamp / programming school; not having a
personal mentor / teacher / coach to teach you (getting advice / tips is fine).

You can self-learn using resources such as Books, E-Books,
Online Courses / Tutorials (not to be confused with a distance-learning
bootcamp) such as YouTube Videos, Udemy Courses, etc. 

Formal Education is always an option though, and depending on the job / role you are aiming for,
you may need a Bachelor's Degree and / or some other certification.










Why be self-taught?

- Learn at your own pace (but try to be consistent)


- Learn whenever


- Learn from where ever you want


- No homework


- Cool thing to flex


- There are lots of resources available


- Resources out there are either Free or Affordable


- Some resources provide certificates


- Unlike school; does not add to your stress and responsibilities


- and much more benefits; you'll love it













Does one need any certifications to get hired?

- This varies per job title / role, and employer(s)












Is Computer Science hard?

- At first it might look complex and hard -- and it might even be hard, but if you stay consistent with your
courses, obtain the information from your resource(s) properly,
you'll be on the path to become a pro.











How can one make money as a Programmer?

- SaaS (Software as a Service; Google, Discord, YouTube, and Windows Operating
Systems are good examples)


- Freelance Work


- A nine-to-five job


- Paid Collaboration








Picking a Programming Language:

There are many Programming Languages out there such as Python, C, C++, C#, Java,
Javascript, Go (aka Golang), etc.

Beginners should start with Python or Golang, which are popular Programming Languages that are used widely.

Python is General-Purpose (meaning it can be used for anything), Object-Oriented
Programming Language (meaning it supports Object-Oriented Programming, which you'll
see in most languages).

Golang (The name is Go, but many refer to it as Golang) is also General-Purpose, but it is not Object-Oriented like Python.


Python and Golang are simple but powerful languages and they serve as a good basis for beginners. Once you learn
Python or Golang, other Programming languages will be easier for you to learn, in fact, 
most are pretty similar to the one of the two or both in their own ways, just with different syntax.





To install Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
and install the latest version of Python.

To install Golang, go to https://www.go.dev/dl/
and install the latest version of Golang.









Choose a Text Editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment)


Popular Text Editors:

- Visual Studio Code (Recommended)


- Sublime Text


- Atom


- Notepad++


- Vim (Not recommended for beginners)


- Neovim (Not recommended for beginners)











Popular IDEs:

- Visual Studio


- Pycharm (Python IDE)


- GoLand (Golang IDE)


















Install the IDE / Text Editor of your choice




Setup for Visual Studio Code:

- Go to https://www.code.visualstudio.com/


- Download Visual Studio Code (Community is Recommended)


- If you chose to begin with Python and have it installed, follow these steps:
    - Open Visual Studio Code
    - Go to the Extensions Marketplace
    - Search for 'Python'
    - Install the Official Python extension
    - If it says 'Reload Required' after installing, click it to Reload


- If you chose to begin with Golang and have it installed, follow these steps:
    - Open Visual Studio Code
    - Go to the Extensions Marketplace
    - Search for 'Go'
    - Install the Official Go extension
    - If it says 'Reload Required' after installing, click it to Reload











[Roadmap] What skills should one learn?

- Any Programming Language of your choice (A General-Purpose language is recommended for beginners)


- Git: Version Control Software


- GitHub: Platform for hosting / publishing, editing / contributing to, and downloading repositories; includes built-in version control


- JSON and / or XML and / or TOML and / or YAML: Data Serialization


- Software Engineering


- SQL: Work with Databases














[Terminology] Module vs Library vs Package vs Framework vs API vs SDK:

- Module: Reusable source code


- Library / Package: A Group of modules, and can even include other libraries / packages


- Framework: A structure used for building applications, like house frameworks are used for building houses


- API (Application Programming Interface): Allows applications to communicate with each other


- SDK (Software Development Kit): Tool(s) used for Software Development













[Terminology] Full-Stack vs Front-End vs Back-End:

- Full-Stack: Combination of the Front-End and Back-End


- Front-End: Client-Side / Interface


- Back-End: Server-Side










[FAQ] What's the best {technology}?

There is no such thing as "the best" X, and X is not better than Y or Z

What I mean by this, is that everything has their own strenghts and weaknesses / pros and cons.

Python is not better than C++ and C++ isn't better than Python.

C++ is not the best programming language. 

Windows is not better than Linux.

Windows is not the best Operating system.

Like said, each technology in Computer Science has its own pros and cons, and may
excell in a particular task / application, but it does not mean that it is better than
another technology (in general).
